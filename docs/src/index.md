# OscillatoryFlows.jl Documentation

## Overview

`OscillatoryFlows.jl` is a collection of modules that use Fourier-based pseudospectral methods to
solve various wave equations that occur in fluid dynamics and other disciplines.

`OscillatoryFlows.jl` leverages the 
[FourierFlows.jl](https://github.com/FourierFlows/FourierFlows.jl) framework.

## Developers

OscillatoryFlows is currently being developed by [Gregory L. Wagner](https://glwagner.github.io) and [Navid C. Constantinou](http://www.navidconstantinou.com).
