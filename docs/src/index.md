# OscillatoryFlows.jl Documentation

## Overview

`OscillatoryFlows.jl` is a collection of modules that use Fourier-based pseudospectral methods to
solve various wave equations that occur in fluid dynamics and other displines.

`OscillatoryFlows.jl` leverages the 
[FourierFlows.jl](https://github.com/FourierFlows/FourierFlows.jl) framework.
